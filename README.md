# About Leventador Pro
## The idea
The Leventador Pro was inspired by the Knife Box Racing Frame, which was the first Box Racing frame released in the USA as well as the PyroCube Frame (which I designed as well).  The idea of the Leventador Pro was to create a design that was 75g or less and with TPU this frame is 78g. This frame has taken may 1st podium positions around the US and has put several Pro Pilots in Top 16 positions at MultiGP Champs and was the prodominate race frame for the Quad Rivals Race Team for 2 years and still being raced by many top pilots today.

## Carbon Fiber sources and CNC Services
If you are planning to market your frames to the public then you will need to source your parts, frame kits and hardware from China.   You can find Carbon Fiber and CNC services on www.https://www.alibaba.com/ and FaceBook.com.  Do not waste your time contacting factories in China unless you are willing to purchase 20 frames or full sheets of parts, otherwise if you attempt to request a few parts or frames they will simply not respond and it will likely lead to you being ignored.   The typical methodology is to have a few proto-types cut using a local CNC service.  It's well worth making sure the design is solid before ordering 20-100 frames from China.  Once you establish a relationship with a factory and I recommend working with a minimum of 2 factories once you get things moving.  Why?  Because China has a tendency change prices or you may start to see a degradation in quality so you need to ensure you have a contingency plan in-place.  

## Prototypes:
If in the US, I have leveraged the following CNC Services for proto-types with great results:
https://cncmadness.com/ and https://great3d.com/

## Production:
I have leveraged the following factories over the years with great results:

* Contact: Wendy Chan 
* Website: carbonfiber-cnc.com
* FaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008947995108
* Email:  info@carbonfiber-cnc.com
* Notes:One of the primary providers of T300 CF for many of the top frames in the business, but she can only provide T300 CF, so if you are in need of higher quality CF you have to go elsewhere, but her T300 quality fit/finish is the best in the business.

* Website:www.jinjiuyi.net
* Email: info@jinjiuyi.net
* Notes: Great source for T700, T800 Carbon Fiber.  This is the same factory that produces the AstroX frames with the slick coating etc.  You will pay a little more for their CF but the quality if very good.

* Website: www.famoushobby.com
* Email
* Contact: freya@famoushobby.com
* Notes: Supplier of CF, CNC Services, Standoffs and Hardware.  Very good, high quality, but their prices are much higher.

* Website: www.xccarbon.com
* Email: sales6@xccarbon.com
* Contact: Yvonne Ling
* Notes: Their prices are high.  Suppler of CF, CNC, Standoffs and Hardware.  Produces frames for many well-known vendors.

* Email: :zhongheng6@szzytqw.cn
* Contact: Ashley
* Skype:live: zhongheng6
* Notes: Very easy to deal with, very reasonable prices, she leverages multiple CF factories.  Can provide any type of CF, but the fit and finish is not as good as jinjiuyi.net.

## Project license
The frame files are released under GNU Public License (GPL) V3. More information here: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html 

## Project naming requirements
Leventador Pro is the name of the frame.  If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR PRO”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have used as basis of the project, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR PRO V1”. 

If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between LEVENTADOR PRO and your project.
Accessories from the LEVENTADOR PRO project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR FPV Camera Mount”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “SOUTHEAST LEVENTADOR FPV Camera Mount V1 - V2”.  Accessories for the Leventador Pro are fully compatible with the Leventador Sport.
